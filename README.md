# PoC for BIND9 TKEY assert DoS (CVE-2105-5477)

This exploit tests to see if a BIND9 server is vulnerable by sending
the exploit in order to see if it crashes.

It's C code that you compile the normal way on Unix/Window, such as:

	# gcc tkill.c -o tkill

It'll run over both IPv4 and IPv6.

This is what it looks like running against `localhost`. Since it gets
two IP addresses resolving the name, it'll try both of them.
It first queries the "version" string, then sends the exploit.
When it probes the second address, the version query fails because
the service is already crashed from the first attempt.
